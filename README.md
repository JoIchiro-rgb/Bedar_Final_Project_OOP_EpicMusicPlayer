# Bedar_Final_Project_OOP_EpicMusicPlayer

# Project Overview
# The Epic Music Player project is a Java-based application that aims to provide an engaging and interactive audio listening experience inspired by Odysseus' mythological tales. The system combines Java programming ideas such as encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction with file management and audio processing capabilities to provide users with a dynamic music-playing experience. This project is ideal for instructional purposes, particularly for students studying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and Java file management.

# OOP Principles
# Encapsulation
# Code Examples: AudioManager and Playlist
# Explanation: Restricts direct access to internal states and ensures modification is done via controlled methods.

# Inheritance
# Code Examples: 	MusicPlayer extends AudioManager
# Explanation: 	Reuses AudioManager's functionality while adding new features like auto-play and playlist integration.

# Abstraction
# Code Examples: MusicPlayerController
# Explanation: 	Simplifies user interaction by hiding complexities of playlist and audio management.

# Polymorphism 
# Code Examples: Overridden methods in MusicPlayer
# Explanation: Enables flexible behavior by enhancing AudioManager's methods while maintaining compatibility.

# Sustainable Development Goals
# The project is on SDG 4: Quality Education, trying to support inclusive and equitable quality education while making lifelong learning possibilities available for all. Thus, as a demonstration of the principles of object-oriented programming using Java, this becomes a perfect educational tool for students on key programming concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. The structured code design promotes modular programming comprehension and use, forming the foundation for sophisticated software development. Moreover, the use of audio playback introduces the student to multimedia programming, which may be used to develop instructional tools such as an audio-based learning platform. Overall, the initiative fosters learning by real-life examples and hands-on, interactive coding that encourages computational thinking.

# Instructions
# 1. Select a Saga:
# * Choose a saga from the options (1-8) to load and play its corresponding playlist of epic tracks. Each saga offers a unique set of music files.

# 2. Control Playback:
# * While a track is playing, you can manage the playback using the following commands:

# * pause: Pause the current track.
# * resume: Resume playback from where it was paused.
# * stop: Stop playback and reset the track.
# * next: Skip to the next track in the playlist.
# * exit: Exit the current saga or the program entirely.

# 3. Exit the Program:
# * During the saga selection menu, choose option 9 to quit the program. Alternatively, type exit during playback to stop the current track and exit.
